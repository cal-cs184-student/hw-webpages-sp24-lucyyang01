			<p>In this homework we implemented the simulation of a cloth as well as its collisions with a plane and sphere. Additionally we enhance its performance and visualization using integration estimators and shaders. In task one we implemented the cloth as a grid of pointmasses connected by various types of springs. In task two we defined how the cloth will interact with various external and internal forces. In task three we implemented the collision between the cloth and external objects. In task four we adjusted the cloth to account for when it collides with itself. We divided the 3D space into smaller portions to simplify how we check the distance between pointmasses that are close to eachother. Finally in task five we implemented different shaders to apply texture and colors to the simulation.

				<h2>Masses and Springs</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="subsection-content">
				<p>The objective of this task was to divide our cloth into a grid of point masses and springs. To build our grid of masses, we compute steps for the x, y, and z coordinates of the point masses based on the width/height and num_width_points/num_height_points. To store point masses in row-major order, we implemented a double for loop that iterates through num_height_points and num_width_points. If the orientation of the cloth is horizontal, we set the y coordinate to 1 and multiply our loop counters by their corresponding x and z steps. If the orientation is vertical, we compute a small random float for the z coordinate and multiply the loop counters by the corresponding x and y steps. We check the pinned vector to see if the coordinates match up with the point mass we’re defining and set the pinned field accordingly. We then iterate through our grid of point masses and add the correct structural, shearing, and bending springs between the point masses.
				</p>
				<p>Some struggles we ran into were ensuring our point masses and springs were stored in row-major order and running into array indexing issues when constructing springs between point masses.
				</p>
				<p>Below you can see the structure of our point masses and springs:</p>

				<h2>Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>

			<div class="subsection-content">
				<p> The spring constant (ks) seems to affect the stiffness of the cloth. A very low ks causes the cloth to ripple intensely and appear almost liquid-like. It seems to be a lot more sensitive to external forces. This can be seen in the image below: 
				</p>
				<img src="../images/[clothsim] lowks pinned.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>A very high ks causes the cloth to appear much more stiff. For example, the rest position of the cloth contains less folds as the default ks of 5000. This can be observed in the following image:
				</p>
				<img src="../images/[clothsim] highks pinned.png" alt="Descriptpion of the image">
				<p>The density of the cloth seems to affect its deformation. A lower density makes the cloth less sensitive to other forces which can be seen through its resting position that resembles what occurs with a high ks:
				</p>
				<img src="../images/[clothsim] lowdensity pinned.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>A higher density makes the cloth seem a bit heavier which could be explained by its increased mass per unit volume. In turn the cloth has a stronger fold in its resting position:
				</p>
				<img src="../images/[clothsim] highdensity pinned.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>The damping coefficient seems to affect the speed at which the cloth falls and how sensitive the cloth’s movement is to the external forces such as gravity. A low coefficient makes the cloth appear very bouncy. It falls quickly and continues to sway back and forth instead of immediately finding a resting position:
				</p>
				<img src="../images/[clothsim] lowdamp pinned.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>A high damping coefficient causes the cloth to fall very slowly. It immediately finds a resting position once the cloth is in a vertical position relative to the pinned points:

				<h2>Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="subsection-content">
				<p>In this task we added support for cloth collision with other objects in the scene. 
				</p>
				<p>To handle collisions with spheres, we first get the distance between the point mass’s position and the origin of the sphere. If the distance is smaller than the radius of the sphere, the point mass is inside the sphere, so we calculate the correction vector to apply to the point mass’s last position in order to bump its position up to the surface of the sphere at the tangent point, taking friction into account.
				</p>
				<p>To handle collisions with planes, we first determine if the point mass has crossed over to the other side of the plane by calculating the signed distances from the point mass’s previous and current positions to a point on the plane. If multiplying these distances yields a negative number, we know that the point mass has crossed the plane. If the point mass has crossed, or is on/about to be on the plane, we calculate the correction vector to apply to the point mass’s last position to bump the point mass’s position to the tangent point on the plane.
				</p>
				<p>A significant challenge we faced in this part was collision detection with the plane. Our incorrect calculation of the tangent point caused various incorrect behaviors of the cloth, including bouncing up and down, being flung like a rubber band into the distance, or falling through the plane. We were able to fix this problem by correctly computing the tangent point.
				</p>
				<p>The resting state of the cloth varies depending on the value of ks, the spring constant.</p>
				<p>When ks = 5000:</p>
				<img src="../images/ks5000.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>When ks = 500:</p>
				<img src="../images/ks500.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>When ks = 50000:</p>
				<img src="../images/ks50000.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>As can be seen from the images above, when the value of the spring constant is lower, the cloth is more drapey because the springs are less stiff at lower values. At higher values, the cloth is more rigid and it retains more of its original shape from the initial position, since the springs connecting the point masses are very stiff. </p>

				<p>A higher density or a lower ks makes the cloth appear thinner and folds into itself more aggressively, meanwhile a lower density or a higher ks makes the cloth appear more sturdy and “heavier.” In the sense that it folds into itself less as it collides with the plane.

				<h2>Shaders</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="subsection-content">
				<p>Shader programs create visual effects in computer graphics by manipulating vertices and pixels. Vertex shaders operates on individual vertices of the 3D model and perform translation and rotation, while fragment shaders compute the final color of pixels based on textures, material properties, and lighting. The vertex and fragment shaders manage and coordinate the rendering process in the GPU, so these systems all work together.</p>
				<p>Blinn-Phong shading calculates the intensity of light reflected from a surface based on the ambient, diffuse, and specular components. In our implementation, we calculate the direction of light from the fragment and the view direction from the fragment to the camera and use this to compute the half vector. We then calculate the diffuse reflection intensity by taking the dot product of the normal vector and the light direction and clamp it to 0 if it’s negative, and the specular reflection intensity by taking the dot product of the normal and half vectors raised to 128. We then compute the specular, diffuse, and ambient components according to the Blinn-Phong equation and combine them for the final color output.

				<p>Displacement mapping:</p>
				<img src="../images/[clothsim] displace_sphere.png" alt="Description of the image">
				<p>Bump mapping displaces the normals of the cloth and sphere based on the given texture. This makes the simulation look like the texture has been applied to the cloth and the sphere as if they were “wrapped” with this texture. Displacement mapping displaces both the normals and the vertices of the cloth and sphere. This changes the geometry of the objects in the simulation according to the texture. Instead of the texture “wrapping” the objects, it’s deforming them. </p>
				<p>When we change the sphere’s mesh courseness we don’t notice much of a difference from the bump shader. However, the displacement shader changes the geometry of the sphere differently according to the courseness. At 16 the sphere has a more “spikey” geometry, whereas at 128 its geometry is more directly affected by the divots in the texture.
